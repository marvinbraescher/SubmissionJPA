# JPA Implementation - Class Diagram

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a class diagram using Java Persistence API (JPA). The implemented code showcases the use of JPA for managing and persisting entities in a relational database. The project includes examples of handling articles, courses, and authors, illustrating common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Technologies Used

- **Java Persistence API (JPA):** Used for object-relational mapping in Java applications.
- **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** Utilized alongside JPA for database interactions.
- **Java:** The primary programming language used in the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) compatible with Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Database Management System (DBMS) with JPA support (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[marvinbraescher]/[SubmissionJPA].git

2. **Open the project in your preferred IDE.**

3. **Configure the database connection in the `persistence.xml` file.**

4. **Run the `Main` class to execute the provided examples and see JPA in action.**

## Features

- **Artigo (Article) Management:**
  - Create, read, update, and delete articles.
  - Associate authors and institutions with articles.

- **Curso (Course) Management:**
  - Manage course information, including duration, justification, and objectives.
  - Associate authors with courses.

- **Autor (Author) Management:**
  - Handle author details, including name, emails, and institution.
  - Associate authors with institutions.

## Usage

- Execute the `Main` class to run the sample code.
- Observe the console output for success or failure messages related to CRUD operations.
